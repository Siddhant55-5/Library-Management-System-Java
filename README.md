# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

A complete **Java-based Library Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **File Handling**, **Custom Exceptions**, and **Multithreading** concepts.  
This project demonstrates how to manage a library digitally by storing and managing book, magazine, and journal data using files.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
To design and implement a simple yet efficient Library Management System that allows users to add, issue, and return library items, while demonstrating Java concepts such as file handling, exception management, and multithreading.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**
✅ Add, display, and search library items (Books, Magazines, Journals)  
✅ Issue and return books with validation  
✅ Maintain logs and reports using text files  
✅ Use of **Multithreading** for parallel book operations  
✅ Custom exceptions for invalid or unavailable items  
✅ Persistent storage via `.txt` files (no database used)
